# Mastodon-powered comments on static websites

This repository contains a HTML script including liquid commands and JavaScript, that integrates a Mastodon-powered comment system into a static website. The script is written in a way that it can be used with the static site generator *Jekyll*.


The script is originally written by [Cassidy James](https://github.com/cassidyjames) and the original code can be found in his [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cassidyjames/cassidyjames.github.io/blob/main/_includes/comments.html). A detailed description of the script can be found on [his blog](https://cassidyjames.com/blog/2020/02/25/mastodon-powered-blog-comments/).  I only made  some minor changes to the original script, thus it doesn't matter which version you use. 

In this  [blog post](https://www.fabriziomusacchio.com/blog/2023-07-31-mastodon_blog_comment_system/) you can read,  how to integrate the script into your *Jekyll* website using the [*Minimal Mistakes* theme](https://www.fabriziomusacchio.com/blog/2021-08-11-Minimal_Mistakes_Cheat_Sheet/).
